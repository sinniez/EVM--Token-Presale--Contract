# ERC20-Token-Presale-Smart-Contract

Build ERC20 Token and Launch a Token Pre-Sale

The goal of this exercise is to build Ethereum-based ERC20 token and start a token pre-sale campaign (ICO).
The code of token will be written in Solidity. Before we get started, MetaMask must be installed. Throughout this project, we will use Sepolia Testnet.

## Requirements
MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase, WalletConnect, Rainbow wallet.

## Network
Sepolia Testnet for testing
Ethereum Mainnet for deployment

## Token features
- Type: ERC20
- Name: ERC20 Token
- Symbol: ECT
- Decimal: 18
- Total Supply: 100 billion

##	Presale features
- Presale Supply: 10 billion (10%)
- Presale Period: 30 days
- Presale Stage: 4
- Softcap: 500000 USDT
- Hardcap: 1020000 USDT    
- Price and token amounts for each stage:
  
   | Stage | Price | Token Amount |
   | ----- | ----- | ----- |
   | 1 | 0.00008 USDT | 3 billion |
   | 2 | 0.00010 USDT | 4 billion |
   | 3 | 0.00012 USDT | 2 billion |
   | 4 | 0.00014 USDT | 1 billion |

- Options for buying tokens: ETH, USDT, USDC, DAI
- Claim time: After second public sale ends
- Minimum amount for buying tokens: 100 USDT

Investors who bought tokens before sofcap reached are listed on early investors and can get bonus tokens after presale ends if unsold tokens exist.
